# Hi, I'm Matias Margaritini 👋

I'm a **.NET / C# developer** focused on building **clean, maintainable backend and full-stack applications**, while continuously learning and exploring new tools and practices within the .NET ecosystem.

I currently design, develop, and maintain a **store management system used in production** for a real business, built with **Blazor, .NET, and a Clean Architecture approach**, replacing manual processes with a modern digital solution.

I care about:
- business logic and system behavior
- practical problem-solving
- tinkering, refactoring, and improving flows
- crafting coherent systems

Occasionally, I build **Discord bots** as side projects to experiment with ideas and tools.

## Tech I use
- C#, .NET, ASP.NET Core, Blazor, Radzen
- SQL Server, EF Core
- Clean Architecture
